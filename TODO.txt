# TODO:

1. Adjust build script so that it reads and updates a config file to the next build number iteratively

2. Ask if build should be iterated (and commit to git afterwards)

3. Fix PowerShell script inputs (wrapper) multiple

4. Make work on Linux

5. Perhaps, set up multi-platform (wsl, raspberrypy) build environment
