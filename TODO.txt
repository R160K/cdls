#. Keep improving scripts to allow for e.g. script version control (as opposed to just general version/cdls version).

#. Consider simplifying (i.e. stripping back) the C++ to allow better compatibility with older systems. Current potential issues with regex and string.starts_with. Do we really need to do things this way?

#. Add a silent option -s --silent that allows using cdls interpretation to change directories without ls'ing. (Can primarily be done via wrapper scripts; perhaps a function-based option for library use can be considered).
