#. Keep improving scripts to allow for e.g. script version control (as opposed to just general version/cdls version).

#. Consider simplifying (i.e. stripping back) the C++ to allow better compatibility with older systems. Current potential issues with regex and string.starts_with. Do we really need to do things this way?

#. Add a silent option -s --silent that allows using cdls interpretation to change directories without ls'ing. (Can primarily be done via wrapper scripts; perhaps a function-based option for library use can be considered).

#. Trying to build a CMake build option. May be overkill for a project like this. Perhaps providing basic build tools for different platforms will suffice.

#. Add powerful option to connect via sftp and copy and edit files on host machine.
cdls shell commands (mv, cp, rm, sftp etc.) would be very powerful. Avoid overhead of full fs mounting (and problems), but allow directory traversal, copyimg to tmp and editing etc.
